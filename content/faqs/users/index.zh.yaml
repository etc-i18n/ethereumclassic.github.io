      comparison:
        question: Can I use Ethereum Classic (ETC) in the same way as Ethereum (ETH)?
        answer: |
          Yes, Ethereum Classic operates to the end user in pretty much exactly the same way as Ethereum. You'll just need to make sure the wallet, application, exchange or other service you are using supports Classic.

          You can use MetaMask with Ethereum Classic.
      metmask:
        question: How do I use ETC with MetaMask?
        answer: |
          You can easily add Ethereum Classic to MetaMask via the [CoinList.org](https://coinlist.org/en/chain/61) website. If you want to manually configure MetaMask to use a custom Ethereum Classic RPC node, you can check out the [MetaMask](/guides/metamask) guide.
      explorers:
        question: How can I view my Ethereum Classic transactions?
        answer: |
          The most popular and fully-featured Ethereum Classic explorer is [BlockScout](https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/), but there are also several alternatives available in the [block explorers](/network/explorers) section.
      exchange:
        question: How can I get ETC?
        answer: |
          Ethereum Classic is listed on pretty much every major cryptocurrency [exchange](/services/exchanges), where you can purchase ETC with fiat currency or trade other cryptocurrencies for it.

          If you have a reasonably modern graphics card, you can also [mine](/mining) it for yourself.
      wallets:
        question: Which wallet do you recommend I use with Ethereum Classic?
        answer: |
          There are many different types of wallet available depending on your use case. Check out the [wallets](/services/wallets) section for more information.
      apps:
        question: What apps are running on the Ethereum Classic network?
        answer: |
          Everything from centralized exchanges, DEXs, DeFi, NFTs, cross-chain bridges, and more. Check out the [services](/services) section to find out more.
      defi:
        question: Does Ethereum Classic have DeFi?
        answer: |
          Yes. A small, but growing decentralized finance ecosystem exists on Ethereum Classic, see the [finance](/services/apps/finance) app category for updates.
      staking:
        question: Can I stake my ETC?
        answer: |
          No, at least not as you would on a Proof of Stake blockchain. ETC is a Proof of Work blockchain, so you can only mine, not stake, to provide security to the network.

          There may be some [lending protocols](/services/apps/finance) that allow you to loan out your ETC for a yeild, but these are not part of the Ethereum Classic protocol itself, and come with counter-party risk.
      safety:
        question: I heard that Ethereum Classic was 51% attacked. Is it safe to use?
        answer: |
          In 2020, Ethereum Classic had a historically very low hashrate, which led to a series of 51% attacks. It is beleived that attackers rented out hashrate and targeted exchanges with double spend attacks, who in total lost around $10m in ETC.

          In response, Ethereum Classic clients and the wider ecosystem since implemented a number of countermeasures, such as longer confirmation times on exchanges, ECIP-1099, and MESS. Since these countermeasures have been in place, there have been no further 51% attacks.

          Moreover, since Ethereum's switch to Proof of Stake in 2022, ETC became the largest GPU-minable chain, increasing it's hash rate by 50x to 100x since the last 51% attack. This has made it exceedingly unlikely that a pool of hashrate is available to rent out to perform another 51% attack, and even if it was, would prohibitively expensive to do so without any guararuntee of success.

          As with all Proof of Work blockchains, the potential for 51% attacks to occur is a necessary part of the protocol's design. As time goes on and Ethereum Classic continues to no longer be attacked in this way, stakeholders can be increasingly confident that 51% attacks are a thing of a past.

          In any case, it does not make financial sense for 51% attackers to target small holders, and they aren't able to "steal" your ETC. Rather, they typically target exchanges by double-spending withdrawals. Historically, exchanges have been able to absorb these relatively small-scale attacks, and have implement countermeasures as described.
      deposit:
        question: Why does it take so long to deposit ETC?
        answer: |
          As mentioned in the above question, as a countermeasure to 51% attacks, some exchanges have extremely long deposit times for Ethereum Classic. This helps defend the exchange from being a victims of a double spend attack, but means users need to wait more time for deposits to be confirmed.

          As the hashrate of ETC has recently increased significantly, it is likely that exchanges will reduce the number of confirmations required to completed deposits.
