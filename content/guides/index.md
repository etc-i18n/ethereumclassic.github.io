Ethereum Classic, being technologically very similar to Ethereum, shares a body of work in user guides, tutorials and walkthroughs that apply to both chains. As far as the protocol goes, everything that you can do on Ethereum can be done in pretty much the same way on Ethereum Classic, which is why the [community guides on Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) are highly recommended reading.

To supplement this, this section contains Ethereum Classic specific materials, covering everything from the basics, to guides for general user, and tutorials for developers.
