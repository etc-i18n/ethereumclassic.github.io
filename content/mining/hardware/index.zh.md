Mining Etherum经典与Mining Etherum几乎完全相同，并且支持相同的硬件和采矿软件。 Mining Ethereum Classic is almost identical to mining Ethereum, and supports the same hardware and mining software. If you are a recently evicted Ethereum miner, Ethereum Classic loves its miners and welcomes you, and you can start mining ETC using your existing hardware by simply switching to a [mining pool](/mining/pools) that supports Ethereum Classic.

## ETCHash

ETC 采矿算法与Etherum的 ETHash几乎完全相同，因为一个小规模的升级使它更方便矿工。 The ETC Mining algorithm is almost identical to Ethereum's ETHash, with a small upgrade that made it more miner friendly. In late 2020, during the [Thanos upgrade](/blog/2020-11-27-thanos-hard-fork-upgrade), ETC implemented [ECIP-1099](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1099), which tweaked the ETHash algorithm into what became known as ETCHash.

Basically, in 2020, Ethereum's DAG exceeded 4 GB, meaning that many GPUs with 4 GB of memory would be unable to continue mining ETH. In response, Ethereum Classic tweaked it's algorithm to ensure that cards with 4 GB would be able to continue mining ETC until [approximately mid-2025](https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator). 答复， 以太久经典调整了它的算法，以确保含4GB的卡片能够继续开采ETC直到 [大约2025年中](https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator)。 答复， 以太久经典调整了它的算法，以确保含4GB的卡片能够继续开采ETC直到 [大约2025年中](https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator)。

## 硬件要求

有两种类型的硬件可以用来开采以太基古典获利。

### GPU

Generally, the best graphics cards to mine Ethereum Classic are the most power efficient cards with at least 4 GB of memory. Before picking a GPU, look for reviews specifically about mining ETCHash. You can search online for the "Best GPUs for mining Ethereum Classic in [current year]" for suggestions, and visit [WhatToMine](https://whattomine.com/coins?e4g=true) for more info. 在选择GPU之前，具体寻找关于开采ETCHash的评论。 Generally, the best graphics cards to mine Ethereum Classic are the most power efficient cards with at least 4 GB of memory.

### ASICs

ASICs, or Application Specific Integrated Circuits, are specially manufactured chips that are designed, as the name suggests, to mine just one specific algorithm. Originally, due to the memory-intense requirements of the DAG, ETHash was fairly resistant to ASICs, but with time, like all profitable algorithms, there was a big incentive to build ASICs for ETHash, which did come to market. 最初，由于DAG的记忆强度要求，ETHash对ASIC具有相当强的抗性，但随着时间的推移有相当大的抗性。 像所有有利可图的算法一样，为进入市场的ETHash构建ASIC的动力很大。

有各种各样的ASIC矿工以太西古经典，可以通过在线搜索“ETHash ASIC矿工”来找到。 并检查制造商的规格是否支持ETCHash。
