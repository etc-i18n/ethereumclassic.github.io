# EthCC[5] Talk: Vitalik Buterin Endorses Ethereum Classic as Proof of Work EVM

The Ethereum Foundation nears its soft date of September 19, 2022 for the network's migration to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In a clip capture by Donald McIntyre of [EtherPlan](https://ethereplan.com), Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's most prominent co-founder, gave an endorsement of the original Ethereum network-- Ethereum Classic. This endorsement was offered to the ETH-centric crowd as a reasonable solution to those not thrilled about the Ethereum Foundation's chain migrating to Proof-of-Stake consenses.

> Who here wants to cancel Proof of Stake?...There are plenty of blockchains, like there is Ethereum Classic, which is the original Ethereum which did not betray the vision by forking TheDAO. It's a very welcoming community and I think they'll definitely welcome Proof of Work fans...If you like Proof of Work, you should go use Ethereum Classic. It's a totally fine chain.
