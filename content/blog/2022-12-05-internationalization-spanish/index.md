It is a pleasure to announce that the EthereumClassic.org website is now available in Spanish.

The main content on this website (including this blog post) has been automatically machine-translated into Spanish and can be viewed by using the globe icon at the top right of each page. 

Historical blog posts and user-submitted submitted content such as apps are not translated, but can be. Videos and news links available in specific languages are also able to be listed.

As these translations were generated by a computer, there may be grammatical and contextual errors throughout, but now that the internationalization (i18n) system and contribution workflow is live, we encourage community members to help us improve this content.

Translations are managed via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com), a popular service for collaborating on localization, which should make the contribution process as seamless as possible. Crowdin has graciously granted the Ethereum Classic project an open source license, which allows us to use their service for without payment.

In the coming weeks, additional languages will also be added including German, French, Greek, Hindi, Croatian, Malay, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Russian, Arabic, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese.
