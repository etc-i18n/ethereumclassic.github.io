title: Wallets
seo: A source of web wallets, extensions, software wallets, hardware wallets, and other ways to secure ETC.
description: |
  There are many options of wallets to choose from to secure and use ETC. Each option gives a different balance between security and convenience. Please research the best option depending on your requirements.

  ## Which Wallet Should I use?

  The following suggestions are not endorsements, and serve only to help new users quickly find an option that probably works for them.

  - If you want a simple mobile app, [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/ethereum-classic-wallet) is easy to use and support many currencies including ETC.
  - If you want to hold small amounts of ETC for use with decentralized applications, then try [MetaMask](/guides/metamask) and connect it to Ethereum Classic.
  - If you are accepting ETC for your business, you probably just want to create an [exchange](/services/exchanges) account that you can use to sell it for your local currency.
  - If you are holding larger amounts, it is highly recommended to purchase a [Hardware Wallet](#hardware-wallets).
  - For more advanced use cases, please do your own research and try a few options from below.
