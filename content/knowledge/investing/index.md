seo: Research materials for investors looking to learn more about Ethereum Classic's long term value proposition.
---

Ethereum Classic presents a unique investment opportunity as it is one of the few truly neutral blockchain projects. The protocol treats all participants equally. This means that if you purchase ETC, you are contributing directly to the network's security, and there is no central organization that disproportionately benefits from this contribution. 

On chains that have an undiluted premine or a dev team that receives a portion of the block reward, not only does this group tax your contribution, but it will be diverted away from network security, either directly from miners or in the form of negative price pressure as value is liquidated to pay for this group's expenses.

Ethereum Classic, thanks to the [ultrafair redistribution](/why-classic/genesis#free-money-and-the-ultrafair-redistribution), does not have a central organization that is continually liquidating their premine, which pushes the price down at the expense of holders. Moreover, as with Bitcoin, ETC has a known future supply rather than one that can be inflated away at the whim of an opaque organizing committee, which redistributes value away from holders.  

The following materials discuss relevant information aimed at investors and those looking to understand the potential upside and value proposition of ETC.
