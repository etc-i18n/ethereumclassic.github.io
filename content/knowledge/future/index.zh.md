Unlike many other blockchain projects, Ethereum Classic does not have a central organizing committee calling the shots, so what gets implemented in the protocol is determined through an organic, meritocratic, emergent system, rather than top-down. While this approach is not designed at first to yield explosive expansion, the trade-off is made for long term sustainability, and Ethereum Classic's persistence has put it in a strong position for its next stage of growth when network effects begin to snowball adoption. 虽然这种办法最初并不是为了扩大规模，但是为了长期的可持续性而做出了权衡。 因此，当网络效应开始采行雪球时，古典的持续性使它处于下一阶段增长的强大地位。

在本节中，我们将解析这一进程，对ETC的现状进行高层次的概述。

## 升级流程

像比特币一样，太太太古典在传统软件开发意义上没有路线图。 而是一个能够在出现这些特点并得到社区批准的情况下实现这些特点的过程。

### ECIP

The [Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP) process](/development/ecips) is how upgrades to Ethereum Classic are discussed, and rigorously vetted by its developer community. This process is open, and anyone can contribute by drafting an ECIP that may one day be included in Ethereum Classic. 这个过程是开放的，任何人都可以通过起草一个ECIP做出贡献，这个ECIP可能有一天会被纳入Ethereum Classic。 这个过程是开放的，任何人都可以通过起草一个ECIP做出贡献，这个ECIP可能有一天会被纳入Ethereum Classic。

### 缓慢移动 & 不要打破事物

Typically, implementing new features requires overwhelming support or, at least, no significant opposition from the Ethereum Classic community, making ETC, like BTC, fairly cautious in its technological development. With no central group biasing decisions about what upgrades are implemented, the threat of a chain split due to significant pushback means that Hard Forks on ETC tend to be safe, incremental and above all non-contentious. 没有中央小组对执行什么升级做出偏差决定， 由于大量推回而造成链条分割的威胁意味着ETC上的硬叉往往是安全、渐进的，而且最重要的是没有争议。 没有中央小组对执行什么升级做出偏差决定， 由于大量推回而造成链条分割的威胁意味着ETC上的硬叉往往是安全、渐进的，而且最重要的是没有争议。

Rather than a "move fast and break things" mentality, which can cause financial harm if things go wrong, significant updates are typically mulled, refined and tested over long periods before being implemented into the protocol so that consensus can be properly reached _before_ a fork.

此外，还应注意确保尽可能多地确保《公约》所规定的权利得到尊重。 早在2015年就部署的合同可以忠实地运作， _代码是法律_ 仍然有效。

这并不意味着考试和测验中心无法进行机会创新。 This does not mean that ETC is unable to innovate opportunistically. One such example is the [Thanos fork](/knowledge/forks#thanos), which took advantage of Ethereum's increasing DAG size sweep up security by allowing an otherwise abandoned category of GPUs to mine ETC, which was an easy win-win upgrade for Ethereum Classic.

### 继承的Innovation

以太久经典能够保持与 Ethereum 虚拟机的兼容性，它继承了其他EVM 链上出现的所有创新。 包括合同系统、开发者工具、图书馆和其他主要由这些其他链提供资金并为之开发的一般概念。

乐观的滚动是一个很有希望的第二层技术，通过非链交易提高可扩展性，就是这方面的一个很好的例子。 由于自由开放源码软件的性质， 与以太基姆古典无关的项目和小组花费了数百万美元的研究和开发费用。 由于普遍采用EVM兼容性，这一创新间接地提高了ETC的效用和价值。

### 以太空为测试网

One advantage of this approach is that Ethereum Classic can stand by while watching other chains take on the risk of implementing new features. Only after they have shown to be safe and effective, good features can be implemented with minimal risk and development effort. 只有在显示出安全和有效之后，才能以最低限度的风险和发展努力来实现良好的特点。 只有在显示出安全和有效之后，才能以最低限度的风险和发展努力来实现良好的特点。

这样，其他EVM链就可以被看作是乙烯共聚物类的激励性测试网。 与传统的试验网相比，更严格的试验网可以提供更多的试验。

## 展望未来

截至撰写本报告时，2022年刚刚到达，考试和测验中心正在年初活动激增。 As of writing, 2022 has just arrived, and ETC is beginning the year experiencing a surge of activity. A litany of new [apps](/services/apps) and users have organically coalesced, and the ETC ecosystem is starting to show signs of network effects, which will snowball adoption as the network becomes more useful and valuable.

最近增长的部分原因是Ethereum Classic Content Creaters and influencers 不断增加，他们一直在创建 [视频](/videos) and memes, • 通过社会媒体推动收养。

### 合并

EtherumTM mainnet链，尽管出现了一些小的延迟， 看起来越来越接近于完成从工作证明到标题为“ _合并_ ”的利益证明的迁移。 Ethereum™ mainnet chain, although experiencing some minor delays, is looking increasingly close to completing a migration away from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, known as _The Merge_. For Ethereum Classic this will be an extremely relevant event, as it seems likely newly evicted GPU miners will be looking towards other chains to mine, and Ethereum Classic is an obvious choice.

矿工从ETH迁移到ETEC很可能会给Ethereum Classic 生态系统带来新的兴趣。 增加网络安全性并加速采用和网络值。

Additionally, if there are any short term problems during or after "The Merge", perhaps due to unforeseen game theory problems or protocol exploits due to additional complexity, Ethereum Classic will be ready and waiting to provide a fallback chain that remains on the tried and true Ethereum protocol of today. In the long term, the move to Proof of Stake will likely result in further centralization of Ethereum™ mainnet, which makes it vulnerable to other kinds of social attacks, which again, ETC will remain immune to. 从长远来看，转用“利益证明”很可能导致埃瑟姆TM型主干网的进一步集中， 它使它容易遭受其他类型的社会攻击，而这种攻击也将使它不会受到影响。 从长远来看，转用“利益证明”很可能导致埃瑟姆TM型主干网的进一步集中， 它使它容易遭受其他类型的社会攻击，而这种攻击也将使它不会受到影响。

### EVM Versioning

With Ethereum Classic aiming to maintain _Code is Law_ for many decades, if not centuries to come, a feature of major utility will be that of _versioning_ of deployed contracts. This provides several significant advantages to the long term operation and maintenance of Ethereum Classic, notably that it makes it far easier to maintain _Code is Law_ whilst still providing flexibility for upgrading contract execution in the future. 这为以太久为基础的古典的长期运作和维护提供了若干重要的优势。 特别是它使得保持 _更容易得多的代码是法律_ ，同时仍然为将来升级合同执行提供了灵活性。

Rather than worrying about whether a protocol change, such as gas repricing, would break old contracts, versioning would mean deployed code is guaranteed to always run on a compatible version of the EVM based on the block number it was deployed to. In additional, future contracts could opt-in to functionality that would otherwise break old contracts, meaning Ethereum Classic can provide new technology like signature schemes, add or modify opcode behavior, etcetera, without affecting existing applications. 此外，未来的合同可能选择适用于否则会打破旧合同的功能。 Etherum经典可以提供新技术，例如签名计划、添加或修改opcode 行为等等，而不影响现有的应用程序。

Even though they are running on a different version of the EVM, future contracts would still be able to communicate with old contracts over the same (or translated) API to maintain interoperability. There appears to be no apparent downside to versioning other than the additional complexity required to implement it. 似乎除了需要执行的额外复杂性外，没有其他明显的不利之处。 似乎除了需要执行的额外复杂性外，没有其他明显的不利之处。

### 图层 2

越来越清楚的是，扩大区块链的唯一合理方法是层级。 It is becoming increasingly clear that the only reasonable ways to scale blockchains is in layers. With Bitcoin's Lightning Network spearheading this promising new domain, Ethereum is following in the form of State Channels, Optimistic Rollups, zk-Rollups, and other emergent technologies.

Layer 2 promises to provide adequate assurances of decentralization and trustlessness, with much greater transaction throughput by managing state off-chain and using the base chain for settling this state. In theory, there is no upper bound to the number of transactions per second in many Layer 2 systems, and can satisfy civilization-scale usage requirements.

有了以太空古典的EVM和对最终将支配ETCHash采矿业的工作证明的承诺， 它将是主权等级基础层支持各种L2解决办法的少数选择之一。
