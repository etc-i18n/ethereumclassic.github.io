以太古经典基金会不是由人民组成的；这是一个想法。

Compared to other blockchains whose development is guided by corruptible centralized institutions, The Ethereum Classic Foundation is a set of principles designed shepherds decision-making in a way that maximizes ETC's longevity and prevents it from being captured. As an idea, it is immune from many forms of attack, is robust, and can stand the test of time. 作为一种想法，它可以免受多种形式的攻击，是强有力的，能够经受时间的考验。 作为一种想法，它可以免受多种形式的攻击，是强有力的，能够经受时间的考验。

Ethereum Classic没有自上而下的控制，从而导致 [反脆弱性](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility)， 它是由与会者维持和完善一种权力下放理论而实现的，这种理论可以很容易地表述、理解和随着时间的推移长期保持下去。

For Ethereum Classic, its Foundation is its strongest and most crucial element. ETC exists in response to The DAO [incident](/why-classic/genesis), and in recognition that all of a blockchain's utility and value is ultimately downstream of principles. Through the continuous [pursuit](/why-classic/decentralism) of _decentralization maximalism_, ETC's technological and social layers are configured to prevent outside forces from compromising a chain and overruling _Code is Law_. ETC 存在于响应DAO [事件](/why-classic/genesis), 并且认识到区块链的所有效用和价值最终是原则的下游。 ETC 存在于响应DAO [事件](/why-classic/genesis), 并且认识到区块链的所有效用和价值最终是原则的下游。 Through the continuous [pursuit](/why-classic/decentralism) of _decentralization maximalism_, ETC's technological and social layers are configured to prevent outside forces from compromising a chain and overruling _Code is Law_.
