The Ethereum Classic Foundation does not consist of people; it is an idea.

Compared to other blockchains whose development is guided by corruptible centralized institutions, The Ethereum Classic Foundation is a set of principles designed shepherds decision-making in a way that maximizes ETC's longevity and prevents it from being captured. As an idea, it is immune from many forms of attack, is robust, and can stand the test of time.

There is no top-down control over Ethereum Classic, which leads to an [antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility), and is achieved by participants maintaining and refining a doctrine of decentralization that can be easily articulated, understood, and perpetuated over time.

For Ethereum Classic, its Foundation is its strongest and most crucial element. ETC exists in response to The DAO [incident](/why-classic/genesis), and in recognition that all of a blockchain's utility and value is ultimately downstream of principles. Through the continuous [pursuit](/why-classic/decentralism) of _decentralization maximalism_, ETC's technological and social layers are configured to prevent outside forces from compromising a chain and overruling _Code is Law_.
