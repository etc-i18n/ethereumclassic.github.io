  Clients are software packages that can be used to run the Ethereum Classic protocol in various modes; Full Nodes, Archive Nodes, Fast Sync Clients, etc. Clients allow you to run a mainnet or testnet node, validate blocks through mining, and interface with the network through API.

  You can find additional tools to help manage client deployments in the [tooling](/development/tooling) section.
